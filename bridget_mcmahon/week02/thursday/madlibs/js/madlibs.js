Create a new Javascript file and link to it with a script tag at the bottom.

Add an event listener to the button so that it calls a makeMadLib function when clicked.

In the makeMadLib function, retrieve the current values of the form input elements, make a story from them, and output that in the story div (like "Pamela really likes pink cucumbers.")
